# AGENTS.md — Booksgalore

This file provides full context for any AI coding agent working on this project. Read it entirely before making any changes.

## Project Summary

**Name:** Booksgalore
**Tagline:** "Treat your shelf!"
**Author:** WolfySaurian Studios

Booksgalore is a web app where users search for books or authors, view results in a card grid, and save books to a personal reading list. The reading list persists across sessions. Each saved book can be toggled between "Want to Read" and "Read".

---

## File Structure

```
booksgalore/
├── index.html      # App shell and all markup
├── style.css       # All styling, CSS variables, layout
└── app.js          # All logic: search, UI interactions, database
```

All three files must remain separate. Do not consolidate them into one file. Do not introduce a build system, bundler, or package manager. The app must run as plain static files, deployable directly to GitHub Pages.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

- **Database:** TBD

- **External API:** OpenLibrary Search API

- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

No frameworks. No npm. No build steps. CDN links only.

---

## OpenLibrary API

**Search:**

```
GET https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q={QUERY}&fields=key,title,author_name,cover_i,first_publish_year,edition_count&limit=10
```

**Cover image:**

```
https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_i}-M.jpg
```

- Always include the `fields` parameter explicitly — do not rely on default field behaviour.

- If `cover_i` is missing, display a fallback placeholder (warm parchment colour with a book icon).

- Rate limit: 1 request/second. Do not implement polling or auto-search-on-type without debouncing.

---

## Layout & Navigation

The app has two views:

1. **Search view** — default view on load, shows search results

2. **Bookshelf view** — shows the user's saved reading list

A persistent **"Your Bookshelf"** button is always visible in the top left. It is styled like a bookmark or worn label. Clicking it switches to the Bookshelf view from anywhere in the app.

---

## Search Bar

- Located in the **top right corner**.

- Styled to resemble the **spine of a book** when collapsed:

Tall and narrow

- Placeholder text rotated 90 degrees

- Subtle spine texture via CSS

- On click or focus, it **expands horizontally** into a full input field with a smooth CSS transition.

- Uses a terracotta focus ring (`#C4622D`).

- Font: Playfair Display.

---

## Filter Sidebar

- Located on the **left side** of the screen.

- Toggled by a menu icon (stacked lines or stacked book spines).

- **Desktop:** slides in and gently nudges the main content area.

- **Mobile:** overlays the content (does not push it).

- Smooth open/close CSS transition.

Filter options:

Filter
Type
Options

Sort by
Dropdown
Relevance, Year (Newest), Year (Oldest)

Publication era
Radio/Select
Any, Classic (pre-1950), Modern (1950–2000), Contemporary (2000+)

Has cover image
Toggle
On / Off

Minimum editions
Dropdown
Any, 2+, 5+, 10+

Filters are applied client-side to the current result set. They do not trigger a new API call.

---

## Book Cards

Each card in the search results grid displays:

- Book cover image (top, full card width)

- Title (bold, Playfair Display)

- Author name(s) (muted colour, Lato)

- First publish year (muted, small)

- A **Save** button at the bottom (terracotta, rounded)

Clicking anywhere on the card (except the Save button) opens a **detail modal** with full book info.

If a book is already saved, the Save button changes to show its current status and allows toggling.

---

## Book Detail Modal

Opens on card click. Contains:

- Large cover image

- Title, author(s), year, edition count

- Status toggle (if saved): "Want to Read" ↔ "Read"

- Save / Remove button

- Close button or click-outside-to-dismiss

Appears with a fade-in animation. Background overlay: `rgba(0,0,0,0.45)`.

---

## Reading List (Bookshelf View)

- Same card grid layout as search results.

- Each card shows a **status badge**: Amber (`#E8A838`) for "Want to Read", Terracotta (`#C4622D`) for "Read".

- Cards include a toggle button to switch status and a remove button.

- If the list is empty, show a warm, friendly empty state message.

## Design System

### Colours (CSS variables — define in `:root` in `style.css`)

```
--color-bg: #FDF6EE;
--color-surface: #FFF8F2;
--color-primary: #C4622D;
--color-primary-hover: #A84E22;
--color-secondary: #E8A838;
--color-text: #2E1F0F;
--color-text-muted: #7A5C42;
--color-border: #E2D0BC;
--color-overlay: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45);
```

### Typography

```
--font-heading: 'Playfair Display', serif;
--font-body: 'Lato', sans-serif;
```

Load both from Google Fonts in `index.html`.

Font scale: `12px / 14px / 16px / 20px / 28px / 36px`

### Spacing

Base-8 scale: `4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px`

### Cards

- Border radius: `12px`

- Soft box shadow

- Lifts slightly on hover (`transform: translateY(-4px)`)

### Buttons

- Primary: filled terracotta, rounded, Lato font

- Secondary: outlined, terracotta border

- All buttons have clear hover and focus states

## Behaviour Rules

- Do not add any features not described in this file unless explicitly asked.

- Do not change the colour tokens or font choices unless explicitly asked.

- Do not merge the three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`) under any circumstances.

- Always handle missing data gracefully: missing covers, missing authors, missing years.

- The app must be fully functional on both mobile and desktop.

---

## Agent Behaviour

- Read this entire file before making any edits.

- Make the smallest change that satisfies the instruction.

- Do not refactor or reorganise code that is not related to the current task.

- If something is ambiguous, implement the most conservative interpretation and leave a comment in the code flagging the decision.
